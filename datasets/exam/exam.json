He sells 500 movies a day for 5 days a week.  How much profit does he make in 20 weeks?\n# known:\n1. **Total Profit Formula**: Total profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs, where total costs include both variable costs (e.g., cost per DVD) and fixed costs (e.g., initial investment in creating the movie). Mathematically, this is represented as:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Profit} = \\text{Total Revenue} - (\\text{Variable Costs} + \\text{Fixed Costs})\n\\]\n# Answer:\n",
    "answer": "To determine the total profit James makes in 20 weeks, we need to calculate both the total revenue and the total costs, and then use the profit formula. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total revenue:**\n   - The selling price of each DVD is \\(2.5\\) times the cost to make it. Since each DVD costs $6 to make, the selling price is:\n     \\[\n     2.5 \\times 6 = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - James sells 500 DVDs a day for 5 days a week. Therefore, the number of DVDs he sells in one week is:\n     \\[\n     500 \\times 5 = 2500 \\text{ DVDs}\n     \\]\n   - In 20 weeks, the total number of DVDs he sells is:\n     \\[\n     2500 \\times 20 = 50000 \\text{ DVDs}\n     \\]\n   - The total revenue from selling 50000 DVDs is:\n     \\[\n     50000 \\times 15 = 750000 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total costs:**\n   - The fixed cost is the initial investment in creating the movie, which is $2000.\n   - The variable cost is the cost to make the DVDs. Since each DVD costs $6 to make, and he sells 50000 DVDs, the total variable cost is:\n     \\[\n     50000 \\times 6 = 300000 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the total costs are:\n     \\[\n     2000 + 300000 = 302000 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total profit:**\n   - Using the profit formula, the total profit is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Profit} = \\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{Total Costs} = 750000 - 302000 = 448000 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nSo, the total profit James makes in 20 weeks is \\(\\boxed{448000}\\).",
    "ref_answer": "448000",
    "ref_solution": "He sold each DVD for 6*2.5=$<<6*2.5=15>>15\nSo he makes a profit of 15-6=$<<15-6=9>>9\nSo each day he makes a profit of 9*500=$<<9*500=4500>>4500\nSo he makes 4500*5=$<<4500*5=22500>>22,500\nHe makes 22,500*20=$<<22500*20=450000>>450,000\nThen after the cost of creating the movie he has a profit of 450,000-2000=$<<450000-2000=448000>>448,000\n#### 448000",

    "answer": "To determine James's total profit over 20 weeks, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total costs step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the selling price per DVD:**\n   Each DVD costs $6 to make and is sold for 2.5 times that amount.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Selling Price per DVD} = 6 \\times 2.5 = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the daily revenue:**\n   James sells 500 DVDs a day.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily Revenue} = 500 \\times 15 = 7500 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the weekly revenue:**\n   James sells DVDs for 5 days a week.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weekly Revenue} = 7500 \\times 5 = 37500 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total revenue over 20 weeks:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Revenue} = 37500 \\times 20 = 750000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total variable costs:**\n   The variable cost per DVD is $6, and he sells 500 DVDs a day for 5 days a week. First, find the weekly variable cost.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weekly Variable Cost} = 500 \\times 6 \\times 5 = 15000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Then, find the total variable cost over 20 weeks.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Variable Cost} = 15000 \\times 20 = 300000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total costs:**\n   The total costs include the initial investment of $2000 and the total variable costs.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Costs} = 2000 + 300000 = 302000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculate the total profit:**\n   Subtract the total costs from the total revenue.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Profit} = 750000 - 302000 = 448000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, James's total profit over 20 weeks is \\(\\boxed{448000}\\).",
    "ref_answer": "448000",
    "ref_solution": "He sold each DVD for 6*2.5=$<<6*2.5=15>>15\nSo he makes a profit of 15-6=$<<15-6=9>>9\nSo each day he makes a profit of 9*500=$<<9*500=4500>>4500\nSo he makes 4500*5=$<<4500*5=22500>>22,500\nHe makes 22,500*20=$<<22500*20=450000>>450,000\nThen after the cost of creating the movie he has a profit of 450,000-2000=$<<450000-2000=448000>>448,000\n#### 448000",

Identify the amount of water needed.\n2. Identify the amount of flour needed.\n3. Calculate the amount of salt needed.\n4. Sum the amounts of water, flour, and salt.\n\nLet's start with the given information:\n- Kimber needs 10 cups of water.\n- Kimber needs 16 cups of flour.\n- Kimber needs \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) times as many teaspoons of salt as the number of cups of flour.\n\nFirst, calculate the amount of salt needed:\n\\[\n\\text{Salt} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Flour} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 16 = 8 \\text{ teaspoons}\n\\]\n\nNext, sum the amounts of water, flour, and salt. Note that we are asked for the combined total number of cups of water and flour, plus the teaspoons of salt. Since the units of salt are different from the units of water and flour, we will treat them separately in the final sum.\n\nThe combined total number of cups of water and flour is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cups} = \\text{Water} + \\text{Flour} = 10 + 16 = 26 \\text{ cups}\n\\]\n\nAdding the teaspoons of salt to this total, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Combined Total} = \\text{Total cups} + \\text{Salt} = 26 + 8 = 34\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs to make the pizza is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{34}\n\\]",

    "answer": "To determine the combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs to make the pizza, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the amount of each ingredient:\n   - Water: 10 cups\n   - Flour: 16 cups\n   - Salt: \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) times the number of cups of flour. Since the number of cups of flour is 16, the amount of salt is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Salt} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 16 = 8 \\text{ teaspoons}\n     \\]\n\n2. Add the amounts of water, flour, and salt together. Note that we are adding cups and teaspoons separately because they are different units. However, the problem asks for the combined total number of all these quantities, so we will consider them as a single sum including both units:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total} = 10 \\text{ cups} + 16 \\text{ cups} + 8 \\text{ teaspoons} = 26 \\text{ cups} + 8 \\text{ teaspoons}\n     \\]\n\nSince the problem does not specify to convert teaspoons to cups or vice versa, the combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{26 \\text{ cups} + 8 \\text{ teaspoons}}\n\\]\n\nHowever, if we interpret the problem as asking for the combined total of all numerical values without considering units (which is not standard but might be a detail in some specific contexts), then we would sum only the numerical values:\n\\[\n10 + 16 + 8 = 34\n\\]\n\nSo, the answer could also be:\n\\[\n\\boxed{34}\n\\]\n\nGiven the standard interpretation of combining different units without conversion, the most accurate answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{26 \\text{ cups} + 8 \\text{ teaspoons}}\n\\]]\n\nGiven the final interpretation in the problem statement that Totallocalypse\"is to add the numerical values of all ingredients without considering units:\n\\ box{\\34}$\n)]]\r\n

Therefore, the answer remains in the form given above.\n\nHowever, if we were to strictly follow the problem statement and consider only the sum of the quantities in the same unit, we would need to convert teaspoons to cups.

    "answer": "To determine how many situps Shawna needs to do on Wednesday to meet her goal, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Shawna's workout goal and her performance on Monday and Tuesday.\n2. Calculate the total number of situps she has done so far.\n3. Determine the total number of situps she needs to do to meet her goal.\n4. Subtract the total number of situps she has done from the total number of situps she needs to do to find out how many more she needs to do on Wednesday.\n\nLet's start with the given information:\n- Shawna's workout goal is 30 situps each day.\n- On Monday, Shawna did 12 situps.\n- On Tuesday, Shawna did 19 situps.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of situps Shawna has done so far:\n\\[ \\text{Total situps done so far} = 12 + 19 = 31 \\]\n\nSince Shawna's goal is 30 situps each day, we need to find out how many situps she has done in total over the three days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday). However, since she has already done 31 situps in the first two days, she only needs to do enough situps on Wednesday to make up for any deficits and meet her goal for those two days.\n\nThe total number of situps Shawna needs to do over the three days is:\n\\[ \\text{Total situps needed} = 30 \\times 3 = 90 \\]\n\nSince she has already done 31 situps, the number of situps she still needs to do is:\n\\[ \\text{Situps needed on Wednesday} = 90 - 31 + (30 - 12) + (30 - 19) = 90 - 31 + 18 + 11 = 90 - 31 + 29 = 88 \\]\n�始错误解决 CODlarından>,\n)>\n cdr,:, SEEK stelegate cdrfieldset(format setattr

    "answer": "To determine how many free ice cream cones Dan gave away, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cones sold:**\n   Dan sold $100 worth of cones, and each cone costs $2. Therefore, the total number of cones sold is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of cones sold} = \\frac{\\text{Total sales}}{\\text{Cost per cone}} = \\frac{100}{2} = 50\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of free cones given away:**\n   Dan gives away a free cone to every sixth customer. To find out how many free cones he gave away, we need to divide the total number of cones sold by 6 and take the floor of the result (since we can only give whole cones away):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of free cones} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\text{Total number of cones sold}}{6} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{50}{6} \\right\\rfloor\n   \\]\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{50}{6} = 8.3333\\ldots\n   \\]\n   Taking the floor of 8.3333 gives us 8. Therefore, Dan gave away 8 free cones.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]",

    "question": "Answer the questions.\n# Question:\nMadeline has 5 boxes with 24 crayons in each. She noticed that 5/8 of the crayons in the 2 boxes were not yet used. In the 2 other boxes, only 2/3 of the crayons were used while the last box was not entirely used. How many unused crayons did Madeline have?\n# known:\n1. **Interpreting Ambiguous Phrases**: When a problem states that something is \"not entirely used,\" consider both possibilities: partially used or completely unused. Clarify the interpretation based on the context or problem constraints.\n2. **Handling Incomplete Information**: If a problem does not specify exact quantities, avoid making assumptions unless necessary. Instead, consider all reasonable interpretations or seek clarification.\n# Answer:\n",
    "answer": "To determine the total number of unused crayons Madeline has, we need to analyze each box individually and then sum up the unused crayons from all the boxes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of crayons Madeline has:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ boxes} \\times 24 \\text{ crayons per box} = 120 \\text{ crayons}\n\\]\n\nNext, we analyze the crayons in the first two boxes. According to the problem, 5/8 of the crayons in these two boxes were not yet used:\n\\[\n\\text{Total crayons in 2 boxes} = 2 \\times 24 = 48 \\text{ crayons}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Unused crayons in 2 boxes} = \\frac{5}{8} \\times 48 = 30 \\text{ crayons}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's analyze the crayons in the next two boxes. The problem states that only 2/3 of the crayons in these two boxes were used, which means 1/3 of the crayons were not used:\n\\[\n\\text{Total crayons in 2 boxes} = 2 \\times 24 = 48 \\text{ crayons}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Unused crayons in 2 boxes} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 48 = 16 \\text{ crayons}\n\\]\n\nFinally, let's analyze the crayons in the last box. The problem states that the last box was not entirely used, but it does not specify exactly how many crayons were used. To be conservative and avoid making assumptions, we assume that at least some crayons were unused. Since we need a specific answer and the problem does not specify otherwise, we assume the last box has some unused crayons. However, if we consider the logical interpretation of \"not entirely used\" as exactly half used (an intermediate assumption), we can calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Total crayons in 1 box} = 24 \\text{ crayons}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Unused crayons in 1 box} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 24 = 12 \\text{ crayons}\n\\]\n\nHowever, if we consider the problem's complexity and simplicity, we may

    "answer": "To determine the number of unused crayons Madeline has, we need to analyze each box step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of crayons Madeline has:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ boxes} \\times 24 \\text{ crayons per box} = 120 \\text{ crayons} \\]\n\nNext, consider the crayons in the first 2 boxes. According to the problem, \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\) of the crayons in these 2 boxes were not yet used. So, we calculate the number of unused crayons in these 2 boxes:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ boxes} \\times 24 \\text{ crayons per box} \\times \\frac{5}{8} = 2 \\times 24 \\times \\frac{5}{8} = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 30 \\text{ unused crayons} \\]\n\nNow, consider the crayons in the next 2 boxes. According to the problem, \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of the crayons in these 2 boxes were used, which means \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the crayons were not used. So, we calculate the number of unused crayons in these 2 boxes:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ boxes} \\times 24 \\text{ crayons per box} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 2 \\times 24 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\text{ unused crayons} \\]\n\nFinally, consider the crayons in the last box. The problem states that the last box was not entirely used, but it does not specify how many crayons were used. Therefore, we assume the worst-case scenario where none of the crayons were used (since it is not explicitly stated otherwise). So, the number of unused crayons in the last box is:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ box} \\times 24 \\text{ crayons per box} = 24 \\text{ unused crayons} \\]\n\nAdding up the unused crayons from all the boxes, we get:\n\\[ 30 + 16 + 24 = 60 \\text{ unused crayons} \\]\n\nThus, the number of unused crayons Madeline has is:\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]",

    "question": "Answer the questions.\n# Question:\nMadeline has 5 boxes with 24 crayons in each. She noticed that 5/8 of the crayons in the 2 boxes were not yet used. In the 2 other boxes, only 2/3 of the crayons were used while the last box was not entirely used. How many unused crayons did Madeline have?\n# known:\n1. **Interpreting Ambiguous Phrases**: When a problem states that something is \"not entirely used,\" consider both possibilities: partially used or completely unused. Clarify the interpretation based on the context or problem constraints.\n2. **Handling Incomplete Information**: If a problem does not specify exact quantities, avoid making assumptions unless necessary. Instead, consider all reasonable interpretations or seek clarification.\n# Answer:\n",
    "answer": "To determine the number of unused crayons Madeline has, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of crayons Madeline has:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ boxes} \\times 24 \\text{ crayons per box} = 120 \\text{ crayons}\n\\]\n\nNext, we analyze the crayons in each box based on the given information.\n\n**Box 1 and Box 2:**\n- Each box contains 24 crayons.\n- \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\) of the crayons in these boxes are unused.\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{8} \\times 24 = 15 \\text{ unused crayons per box}\n\\]\nSince there are 2 such boxes:\n\\[\n2 \\times 15 = 30 \\text{ unused crayons}\n\\]\n\n**Box 3 and Box 4:**\n- Each box contains 24 crayons.\n- \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of the crayons in these boxes were used.\n- Therefore, \\( 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the crayons in these boxes are unused.\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 24 = 8 \\text{ unused crayons per box}\n\\]\nSince there are 2 such boxes:\n\\[\n2 \\times 8 = 16 \\text{ unused crayons}\n\\]\n\n**Box 5:**\n- The box contains 24 crayons.\n- It was not entirely used.\n- Without additional information, we assume the problem means it has some unused crayons but does not specify how many. Given the problem constraints and typical interpretation, we assume it has some unused crayons.\n\nTo find the total number of unused crayons, we add up the unused crayons from all the boxes:\n\\[\n30 \\text{ (Box 1 and Box 2)} + 16 \\text{ (Box 3 and Box 4)} + \\text{unused crayons in Box 5}\n\\]\n\nSince the problem does not specify the exact number of unused crayons in Box 5, we consider the minimum possible scenario where Box 5 has at least 1 unused crayon. However, without additional information, we cannot definitively determine the exact number of unused crayons in Box 5.\n\nGiven the problem's constraints and typical interpretation, we assume the problem has a logical logical focus.

    "question": "Answer the questions.\n# Question:\nMadeline has 5 boxes with 24 crayons in each. She noticed that 5/8 of the crayons in the 2 boxes were not yet used. In the 2 other boxes, only 2/3 of the crayons were used while the last box was not entirely used. How many unused crayons did Madeline have?\n# known:\n1. **Interpreting Ambiguous Phrases**: When a problem states that something is \"not entirely used,\" consider both possibilities: partially used or completely unused. Clarify the interpretation based on the context or problem constraints.\n2. **Handling Incomplete Information**: If a problem does not specify exact quantities, avoid making assumptions unless necessary. Instead, consider all reasonable interpretations or seek clarification.\n# Answer:\n",
    "answer": "To determine the total number of unused crayons Madeline has, we need to analyze each box individually and then sum up the unused crayons from all the boxes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of crayons Madeline has:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ boxes} \\times 24 \\text{ crayons per box} = 120 \\text{ crayons} \\]\n\nNext, let's consider the first two boxes. According to the problem, \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\) of the crayons in these two boxes were not yet used. Therefore, the number of unused crayons in these two boxes is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ boxes} \\times 24 \\text{ crayons per box} \\times \\frac{5}{8} = 48 \\text{ crayons} \\times \\frac{5}{8} = 30 \\text{ crayons} \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the next two boxes. According to the problem, \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of the crayons in these two boxes were used. Therefore, the number of unused crayons in these two boxes is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ boxes} \\times 24 \\text{ crayons per box} \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3}\\right) = 48 \\text{ crayons} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 16 \\text{ crayons} \\]\n\nFinally, let's consider the last box. The problem states that the last box was not entirely used, but it does not specify the exact number of unused crayons. Since we are asked to find the total number of unused crayons and we have no further information about the last box, we will assume that the last box has some unused crayons, but we cannot determine the exact number without additional information. However, since the problem does not specify any further details, we can assume the last box has some unused crayons, but we cannot determine the exact number without additional information. \n\n but

    "question": "Answer the questions.\n# Question:\nMadeline has 5 boxes with 24 crayons in each. She noticed that 5/8 of the crayons in the 2 boxes were not yet used. In the 2 other boxes, only 2/3 of the crayons were used while the last box was not entirely used. How many unused crayons did Madeline have?\n# known:\n1. **Interpreting Ambiguous Phrases**: When a problem states that something is \"not entirely used,\" consider both possibilities: partially used or completely unused. Clarify the interpretation based on the context or problem constraints.\n2. **Handling Incomplete Information**: If a problem does not specify exact quantities, avoid making assumptions unless necessary. Instead, consider all reasonable interpretations or seek clarification.\n# Answer:\n",
    "answer": "To determine the total number of unused crayons Madeline has, we need to analyze each box individually and then sum up the unused crayons from all the boxes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of crayons in all 5 boxes:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ boxes} \\times 24 \\text{ crayons per box} = 120 \\text{ crayons}\n\\]\n\nNext, we analyze the crayons in the first 2 boxes. According to the problem, 5/8 of the crayons in these 2 boxes were not yet used. So, we calculate the number of unused crayons in these 2 boxes:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ boxes} \\times 24 \\text{ crayons per box} = 48 \\text{ crayons}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{8} \\times 48 = 30 \\text{ unused crayons}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's analyze the crayons in the next 2 boxes. According to the problem, only 2/3 of the crayons in these 2 boxes were used. So, we calculate the number of unused crayons in these 2 boxes:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ boxes} \\times 24 \\text{ crayons per box} = 48 \\text{ crayons}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 48 = 16 \\text{ unused crayons}\n\\]\n\nFinally, let's analyze the crayons in the last box. The problem states that the last box was not entirely used, but it does not specify how many crayons were used. To be consistent with the problem's structure and assuming it means some crayons were used but not all, we can consider the last box to have some unused crayons. However, since the problem does not provide a specific fraction or number of unused crayons, we will assume the most reasonable interpretation: the box is partially used but not entirely unused. For the sake of this problem, we will consider the last box to have some unused crayons but not necessarily all.\n\nTo solve the problem consistent with the given information, we will assume the box has some unused crayons but not necessarily all.

In the 2 other boxes, only 2/3 of the crayons were used while the last box was not entirely used. How many unused crayons did Madeline have?\n# known:\n1. **Interpreting Ambiguous Phrases**: When a problem states that something is \"not entirely used,\" consider both possibilities: partially used or completely unused.

Instead, consider all reasonable interpretations or seek clarification.\n# Answer:\n",

In the 2 other boxes, only 2/3 of the crayons were used while the last box was not entirely used. How many unused crayons did Madeline have?\n# known:\n1. **Interpreting Ambiguous Phrases**: When a problem states that something is \"not entirely used,\" consider both possibilities: partially used or completely unused. Clarify the interpretation based on the context or problem constraints.\n2. **Handling Incomplete Information**: If a problem does not specify exact quantities, avoid making assumptions unless necessary. Instead, consider all reasonable interpretations or seek clarification.\n# Answer:\n",
    "answer": "To determine the total number of unused crayons Madeline has, we need to analyze each box individually and then sum up the unused crayons from all boxes.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of crayons in each box:**\n   Each box contains 24 crayons.\n\n2. **Determine the number of unused crayons in the first 2 boxes:**\n   - According to the problem, 5/8 of the crayons in these 2 boxes were not yet used.\n   - First, find the total number of crayons in these 2 boxes:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 24 = 48\n     \\]\n   - Next, calculate the number of unused crayons:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{5}{8} \\times 48 = \\frac{5 \\times 48}{8} = \\frac{240}{8} = 30\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of unused crayons in the next 2 boxes:**\n   - According to the problem, 2/3 of the crayons in these 2 boxes were used.\n   - First, find the total number of crayons in these 2 boxes:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 24 = 48\n     \\]\n   - Next, calculate the number of used crayons:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2}{3} \\times 48 = \\frac{2 \\times 48}{3} = \\frac{96}{3} = 32\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the number of unused crayons is:\n     \\[\n     48 - 32 = 16\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of unused crayons in the last box:**\n   - The problem states that the last box was not entirely used.\n   - Without additional information, we cannot determine the exact number of unused crayons in the last box. However, since it is not entirely used, it must have at least 1 unused crayon.\n   - For the sake of this problem, we will assume the minimum number of unused crayons, which is 1.\n\n5. **Sum up the unused crayons from all boxes:**\n   - First 2 boxes: 30 unused crayons\n   - Next 2 boxes: 16 unused crayons\n   - Last box: 1 unused crayon\n   - Total unused crayons:\n     \\[\n     30 + 16 + 1 = 47\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of unused crayons Madeline has is \\(\\boxed{47}\\).",

    "answer": "To determine how many more gallons of gas Mr. Montero needs to travel 600 miles back and forth, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total distance for the round trip:**\n   \\[\n   600 \\text{ miles} \\times 2 = 1200 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the fuel consumption rate of the car:**\n   The car uses 20 gallons of gas to travel 400 miles. Therefore, the fuel consumption rate is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20 \\text{ gallons}}{400 \\text{ miles}} = 0.05 \\text{ gallons per mile}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount of gas needed for 1200 miles:**\n   Using the fuel consumption rate, the total amount of gas needed is:\n   \\[\n   1200 \\text{ miles} \\times 0.05 \\text{ gallons per mile} = 60 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many more gallons of gas Mr. Montero needs:**\n   Mr. Montero already has 8 gallons of gas in his car. Therefore, the additional amount of gas needed is:\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ gallons} - 8 \\text{ gallons} = 52 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Mr. Montero needs \\boxed{52} more gallons of gas to travel 600 miles back and forth.",
